Run this with python3.6+. (I used f-string.)  

Notes:  
1. Use csv type would be the best.  

More todo:  
1. Due to twse would block ip, if want to use multiprocessing, need VPN.
2. Use better things to log, like python build-in lib logging.  
3. Set variables like date_start, sleep_min, sleep_max to be python arguments.  
4. Better control with ConnectionError.
